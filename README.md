    Applications 
   
-->Real-Time Emotion Detection: TensorFlow.js can be used for real-time emotion detection using facial recognition models like FaceAPI.js. With pre-trained models and 
WebGL acceleration enables quick detection and processing of facial landmarks and emotions in real time.

-->Natural Language Processing (NLP): TensorFlow.js can power applications like sentiment analysis or chatbot systems by running text classification models in the browser. 
It can also be used for real-time transcription tasks, improving the responsiveness of audio-to-text systems.

-->Object Detection and Pose Estimation: Using models like PoseNet or Coco-SSD, TensorFlow.js can detect objects, human poses, and even gestures, which is helpful for 
interactive web applications, augmented reality, or gaming.

-->Speech and Sound Recognition: TensorFlow.js, along with tools like React-SpeechRecognition, can be used to implement real-time speech recognition systems, converting 
speech to text, analyzing sentiment, or even detecting a speaker's emotions
